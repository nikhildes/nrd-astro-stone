              I am an entrepreneur, data scientist and AI practitioner working on technologies 
              that will make an impact on climate change and human health. I've helped founders, 
              investors, and large companies make sense of AI technology and how it applies to their
              products, portfolio, and strategy. 
            </p>
            <p class="text-primary-950/70 dark:text-primary-200/70 text-base sm:text-lg">
              As a data science leader, I've led teams in research and development of applied 
              deep learning products, from driver distraction detection and automatic speech recognition 
              to generative AI for customer service applications. Most recently, I've applied AI techniques
              to detect energy anomalies and forecast energy usage in heat pumps for commercial real estate.

              As a cofounder, I've taken an idea from conception to product to revenue. I hired a software team, 
              performed customer discovery, onboarded new users, and continually iterated on the technology. I know 
              how hard these things are, and I'm here to help you gain leverage and expertise in applying AI to your problem.

              I received my PhD in Neuroscience and Molecular Biology from Princeton University, where I developed novel computational models 
              of the retina and built custom hardware to record picoamp signals from neurons to validate my predictions. 
              I earned an undegraduate degree in Bioengineering from the University of Pennsylvania, where I was exposed to the Wharton way of thinking.
